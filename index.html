    <h1>Hello there! I'm <span> Thalia </span></h1>
    <span class ="Title">Software Engineering Student at <a href="https://www.fgcu.edu/"> FGCU </a></span>
    <br>
    <p> Welcome! My name is Thalia Valle Chavez. I’m in my junior year at Florida Gulf Coast University, studying Software Engineering with a minor 
      in Mathematics. I'm genuinely passionate about learning and solving problems, which drew me to this field. I'm particularly interested in its
      potential to drive innovation. I consider myself a learner at heart and consistently work towards improving professionally and personally.
      I am well-versed in topics such as object-oriented programming and data structures, and I have experience in programming languages such as HTML, 
      JavaScript, Python, and C++. On campus, I've been given the opportunity to serve as Vice-President of the Software Engineering Club and the Society
      of Hispanic Professional Engineers.
